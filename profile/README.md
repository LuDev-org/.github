# LuDev is Yifan Lu's so-called company without any money

## Why doing as an Organization
- Because Github Repositories are not in full folder sturcture,
so throwing things in here is somehow equivalent to a new folder
in root dictionary.

- I still want to keep my website in plain html but I'm not skilled
  enough writing my own page generator, so I might install a Hugo
  framework uder the ludev.org domain name.

- Having such a void organization sounds cooler.

## What do I do
Inspired by different people, and studies with professors in school,
I'm not fans of non of the following groups: Studio Mixing Engineer,
EDM Producer,Underground Music Producer, Post-Rock Guitarist,Eurorack
Artists. I just try to do whatever I want, maybe even tough getting
a synthersizer's UI has the same vibe as EDC fetival might be hard
and it can boost the sale, I still prefer the Pure Data type UI.

I generally develop software in JUCE Framework or Max and Reaktor
platform, and I make analogue stuff in project boxes.
